        <h3>Please use either the 'Login' or 'Sign up' links to begin tracking and monitoring your expenses and reimbursements.</h3>

    <p>Our Work Reimbursement System or "WRS" is designed to help you get the most out of your salary and work experience.
        Since many of our employees are travelling consultants, we know that you often incur expenses that you would not have if you were not one of our valued employees.
        To that end, our WRS is designed to help you track your expenses so that we can reimburse you for any purchases we deem as expected and normal in the course of a consultants work week.
        Not all expenses are covered, but we do cover almost all of the basics such as food, work clothing, travel and lodging up to a weekly budget limit.
        Sign Up to begin receiving reimbursements for qualified purchases. Finally, we at Acme Co. would like to thank you for your continued hard work!
    </p>
